Search oriented sms application.

I just didnt like the sms apps in android. It's search was not intuitive in the first place. These days we only want to read/search the sms from businesses.
So this app basically classifies the inbox into different categories like. Known, Unknown, business etc. Search results are shown in an intuitive way. It also had search bookmarks with which we can see the results in single click.
